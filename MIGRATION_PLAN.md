## Migration Progress Summary

### Overall Progress: ~45% Complete

| Phase | Status | Progress | Details |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | ðŸŸ¢ Complete | 100% | All BOMs consolidated, proto files in grpc-stubs |
| Phase 2: Libraries | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 95% | consul-client nearly complete (53/54 tests) |
| Phase 3: Extensions | ðŸ”´ Not Started | 25% | grpc-stubs done as library, 3 extensions remaining |
| Phase 4: Core Application | ðŸ”´ Not Started | 0% | Pipeline engine not migrated |
| Phase 5: Modules & CLI | ðŸ”´ Not Started | 0% | No modules or CLI apps migrated |
| Phase 6: Testing & Cleanup | ðŸ”´ Not Started | 0% | Integration tests pending |

### Test Status
- âœ… Most migrated components have passing tests (53/54 in consul-client)
- âœ… No duplicate keys or conflicts
- âœ… Build successful for all migrated modules
- âœ… Docker client injection working in testing-server-util
- âœ… Jandex indexing fixed for validators and pipeline-api
- âœ… Configuration mapping implemented for pipeline properties
- ðŸŸ¡ 1 test failing due to JSON schema validation issue

### Next Priority Actions
1. **P1 - High Priority**:
   - Fix remaining test failure in `consul-client` (JSON schema validation)
   - Start migrating `dynamic-grpc` extension
   - Begin `pipeline-engine` application migration

2. **P2 - Medium Priority**:
   - Migrate consul dev services extension
   - Start migrating core modules (echo, testing-harness)
   - Set up integration test framework

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) âœ… COMPLETED
1. Create base directory structure âœ…
2. Set up root build files with Gradle Kotlin DSL âœ…
3. Create consolidated BOM (`pipeline-bom`) âœ…
4. Configure version catalog âœ…
5. ~~Create protobuf resource JAR~~ Proto files in grpc-stubs âœ…

### Phase 2: Libraries (Week 1-2) ðŸŸ¡ 95% Complete
1. Migrate pipeline-api (from commons/interface) âœ…
2. Migrate pipeline-commons (from commons/util) âœ…
3. Create consul-client library (from engine/consul) ðŸŸ¡ (53 of 54 tests passing)
4. Migrate testing-commons and other libraries âœ…
   - testing-commons âœ…
   - data-util âœ…
   - validators âœ…
   - testing-server-util âœ…

### Phase 3: Extensions (Week 2-3) ðŸ”´ 25% Complete
1. ~~Migrate grpc-stubs extension~~ Converted to library âœ…
2. Rebuild dynamic-grpc extension properly (not from engine/dynamic-grpc) ðŸ”´
3. Migrate consul dev services ðŸ”´
4. Migrate pipeline-dev-ui ðŸ”´

2. Ensure all dependencies are properly wired ðŸ”´
3. Update configuration for new structure ðŸ”´

1. Migrate echo and testing-harness modules first ðŸ”´
2. Migrate remaining modules ðŸ”´
3. Migrate CLI applications ðŸ”´
4. Update module registration logic ðŸ”´

### Phase 6: Testing & Cleanup (Week 5-6) ðŸ”´ Not Started
1. Update integration tests ðŸ”´
2. Update Docker configurations ðŸ”´
3. Remove old/deprecated code ðŸ”´
4. Final testing and documentation ðŸ”´

## Key Achievements So Far

1. **Successful BOM Consolidation**: All 5 BOMs merged into single `pipeline-bom`
2. **Clean Multi-Module Structure**: Converted from composite builds to regular subprojects
3. **No Split Package Issues**: Resolved by excluding Google proto packages from grpc-stubs JAR
4. **Docker Client Injection**: Created CDI producer for proper injection in testing-server-util
5. **Jandex Indexing**: Fixed missing indexes for validators and pipeline-api libraries
6. **Config Mapping**: Created proper configuration interfaces for pipeline properties
7. **Consul Client Migration**: 98% complete (53/54 tests passing)
8. **Proto Files Management**: Successfully integrated proto files into grpc-stubs library

## Lessons Learned

1. **grpc-stubs as Library**: Works better as a library than extension for this use case
2. **Dependency Scoping**: Changed from `api` to `implementation` for better encapsulation
3. **Docker-Java Version**: Must align with version managed by Quarkus BOM (3.4.2)
4. **Build Structure**: Regular multi-module builds simpler than composite builds for this project
5. **Jandex Indexing**: Libraries need explicit Jandex plugin configuration for CDI bean discovery
6. **Configuration Mapping**: Use `@ConfigMapping` interfaces instead of individual `@ConfigProperty` annotations
7. **Test Configuration**: Provide test-specific application.yml to avoid config validation failures

## Key Decisions

### Extension vs Library
**Extensions** are needed when:
- Build-time processing is required
- Native compilation hints needed
- Dev services or other build augmentation
- Synthetic bean creation at build time

**Libraries** are sufficient when:
- Just providing CDI beans and services
- No build-time processing needed
- Standard runtime functionality

### Module Structure
- Modules remain as Quarkus applications
- Keep existing `src/integrationTest/` structure
- Each module is independently deployable

### BOM Consolidation
- Single BOM instead of 5 separate ones
- Simpler dependency management
- All versions in one place

## Success Criteria
1. All tests passing
2. Native compilation working
3. Dev mode fully functional
4. Docker builds successful
5. Module dynamic loading operational
6. Clear separation of concerns
7. Improved build times

## Risks & Mitigations
1. **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Migrate incrementally with testing at each phase

2. **Risk**: Circular dependencies
   - **Mitigation**: Clear layering with dependency flow rules

3. **Risk**: Lost features during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and feature inventory

4. **Risk**: Team disruption during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Keep old structure running in parallel until ready
