## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Create base directory structure âœ…
2. Set up root build files with Gradle Kotlin DSL âœ…
3. Create consolidated BOM (`pipeline-bom`) âœ…
4. Configure version catalog âœ…
5. Create protobuf resource JAR

### Phase 2: Libraries (Week 1-2)
1. Migrate pipeline-api (from commons/interface)
2. Migrate pipeline-commons (from commons/util)
3. Create consul-client library (from engine/consul)
4. Migrate testing-commons and other libraries

### Phase 3: Extensions (Week 2-3)
1. Migrate grpc-stubs extension
2. Rebuild dynamic-grpc extension properly (not from engine/dynamic-grpc)
3. Migrate consul dev services
4. Migrate pipeline-dev-ui

### Phase 4: Core Application (Week 3-4)
1. Migrate pipeline-engine (from engine/pipestream)
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly wired
3. Update configuration for new structure

### Phase 5: Modules & CLI (Week 4-5)
1. Migrate echo and testing-harness modules first
2. Migrate remaining modules
3. Migrate CLI applications
4. Update module registration logic

### Phase 6: Testing & Cleanup (Week 5-6)
1. Update integration tests
2. Update Docker configurations
3. Remove old/deprecated code
4. Final testing and documentation

## Key Decisions

### Extension vs Library
**Extensions** are needed when:
- Build-time processing is required
- Native compilation hints needed
- Dev services or other build augmentation
- Synthetic bean creation at build time

**Libraries** are sufficient when:
- Just providing CDI beans and services
- No build-time processing needed
- Standard runtime functionality

### Module Structure
- Modules remain as Quarkus applications
- Keep existing `src/integrationTest/` structure
- Each module is independently deployable

### BOM Consolidation
- Single BOM instead of 5 separate ones
- Simpler dependency management
- All versions in one place

## Success Criteria
1. All tests passing
2. Native compilation working
3. Dev mode fully functional
4. Docker builds successful
5. Module dynamic loading operational
6. Clear separation of concerns
7. Improved build times

## Risks & Mitigations
1. **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Migrate incrementally with testing at each phase

2. **Risk**: Circular dependencies
   - **Mitigation**: Clear layering with dependency flow rules

3. **Risk**: Lost features during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and feature inventory

4. **Risk**: Team disruption during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Keep old structure running in parallel until ready
